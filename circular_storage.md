# Circular Storage Tagging

> Version 2019-10-21

## Geometry

This project aims at tagging **circular storage tanks**. Typically oil or chemicals are stored in these tanks. They can be of various sizes. The larger tanks have a floating roof which can be up or down. The various seasons and angles give different views of the tanks. The full tank (roof and walls) must be inside the box.

Draw a tight box around each **circular storage tank**. Include the roof, walls and bottom of each tank.
