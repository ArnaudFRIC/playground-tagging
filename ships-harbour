Ships Tagging in Harbours on Pléiades HR imagery

    Version 2020-05-04

Geometry

This project aims to tag ships in satellite images, using PHR RGB imagery (spatial resolution of 0,5 meters).

Records should be annotated as an oriented bounding-box (with orientation going from back to front of ship) or as a rectangle i.e. a 4-vertices polygon.

Examples of ship geometries
Classes

Every record should be classified as ship.

It is mandatorly expected to also classify the type of ship at level 2, along the following taxonomy:
